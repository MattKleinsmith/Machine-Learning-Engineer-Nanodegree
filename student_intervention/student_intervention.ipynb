    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "### Support Vector Machines\n",
    "\n",
    "1. #### Real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    An application of the SVM learning algorithm is **cancer diagnosis**. This is a classification task, where the features are gene information and the response variable is whether the organism has cancer. [Ref. D]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Strengths:\n",
    "    1. SVM models are still effective when there are more features than observations. [Ref. A]\n",
    "    2. SVM models are memory efficient (the model can be stored as a set of support vectors). [Ref. A]\n",
    "    3. SVMs can be used for both regression and classification. [Ref. A]\n",
    "    4. SVMs are versatile because of their kernel hyperparameter. [Ref. A]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Weaknesses:\n",
    "    1. SVMs are sensitive to noise. Mislabeled observations tend to hurt the performance of SVM models more than other models. [Ref. 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Justification for this problem:\n",
    "    1. When compared to the iris data set which has four features for 150 observations, this data set seems to have enough features (30) compared to its number of observations (395) to justify using SVM.\n",
    "    2. The scikit-learn developers made a flowchart [Ref. B] that suggests using SVM for this dataset. The logic is as follows:\n",
    "        1. More than 50 observations\n",
    "        2. Predicting a category\n",
    "        3. Possess labeled data\n",
    "        4. Less than 100,000 observations\n",
    "        5. Not text data\n",
    "    3. This dataset is likely correctly labeled, which avoids one of the weaknesses of SVMs. This dataset is likely correctly labeled because if it were mislabeled, a student would complain and would have the mislabel corrected.\n",

    "    K-Nearest Neighbor models have been used to classify **handwritten digits**. [Ref. A]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Strengths:\n",
    "    1. KNN models are useful when the decision boundary is irregular (i.e. when the decision boundary is hard to fit with a parametrized model). [Ref. A]\n",
    "    2. KNN models are lazy. This reduces training time.\n",
    "    3. The KNN algorithm is easy to understand and easy to implement. [Ref. B]\n",

    "3. #### Weaknesses:\n",
    "    1. KNN models take up more memory. Instead of storing parameters, they store the entire dataset.\n",
    "    2. KNN models are lazy. This increases query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Justification for this problem:\n",
    "    1. Like with my choice of SVMs, I used the scikit-learn flowchart. [Ref. C]\n",

    "\n",
    "1. #### Real-world application:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Boosting, a type of ensemble method, is used for **object categorization** (a subproblem of computer vision). [Ref. B]\n",
    "\n",
    "2. #### Strengths:\n",
    "    1. By using many classifiers at once, ensemble methods tend to reduce overfitting. [Ref. A]\n",
    "\n",
    "3. #### Weaknesses:\n",
    "    1. Boosting is highly sensitive to noise. [Ref. D]\n",
    "        2. \"[If] any non-zero fraction of the training data is mis-labeled, the boosting algorithm tries extremely hard to correctly classify these training examples, and fails to produce a model with accuracy better than 1/2.\" [Ref. C]\n",
    "    2. Ensemble methods can take a long time to use, since they require the training of multiple models.\n",
    "    3. Boosting requires enough data for each classifier to satisfy the weak learner condition. [Ref. E]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. #### Justification for this problem:\n",
    "    1. Ensemble methods help prevent overfitting at the cost of taking a long time to train. However, since 395 observations is a small dataset, the increased cost of training is likely small.\n",
    "    2. Since the data is unlikely to be unlabeled, boosting's weakness to noise is less likely to matter.\n",
